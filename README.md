I am now working on the transfer logic and a new UI.


This is how the website looks as of now. 
Note: You won't be able to see your spotify playlists if you visit the website just yet because my spotify developer account is in dev mode. 
I can however add you manually to my list of users while spotify processes my extension request.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Spotify Developer account
- AWS account with access to AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Secrets Manager

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Create a Spotify Developer Account
- Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
- Log in with your Spotify account or create a new account.
- Create a new application to obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
- Set the redirect URI in your application settings to match your application's URL.

### 2. Store Spotify Credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- Log in to your AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to **Secrets Manager**.
- Create a new secret and store your Spotify **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
- Note the ARN of the secret, as you will need it for your AWS Lambda functions.

### 3. Deploy the Main Stack Using AWS SAM
- Ensure you have the AWS SAM CLI installed. If not, follow the [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html).
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal.
- Run the following command to build the application:
  ```bash
  sam build
  ```
- Deploy the application using:
  ```bash
  sam deploy --guided
  ```
- Follow the prompts to configure your stack, including setting up the necessary IAM roles and permissions.

### 4. Manually Add Lambda Trigger from User Pool to User Function
- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to **Cognito**.
- Select the **User Pool** you created for your application.
- Under Authentication click Extensions and **Add Lambda trigger**.

- Choose the React template during setup.
- Navigate to the frontend directory of your project in your terminal.
- Install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
